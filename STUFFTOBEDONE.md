- BUGS
  GAMEPLAY

  - When pressing near right corner character select menu gets hidden
    because its always showing on the right of the mouse, add some code
    to determine if its on right and then put it on left

  - When in the game and resizing window, LevelSelectCard event listener is not removed and it causes it to fire hundreds of times
    Level Select Card event listener was for when on mobile to make the level card full width
    of the screen for the horizontal scroll

- !!! PRIORITY BELOW!!!!
- AFTER THAT DEAL WITH BUGS
  PROMPT

- Maybe redirect back to home screen (And reset found characters if not done by redirect)

- maybe add later loading animation until picture is fully
